Author Question: **Giappi**

I have an integer number, which I want to reverse by following steps:

1. Convert the number into binary string.
2. Reverse binary string.
3. Convert the reversed binary string back to integer.

Can you help me write a function to do it ?

**Example**

For `x = 234`, the output should be `ReverseBit(x) = 87`.

`23410 = 111010102 => 010101112 = 8710`.
